                    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the
                        development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to
                        unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Advances in the field of
                        deep learning have allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

                    <p>Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the
                        machine learning field: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to
                        some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by
                        P, improves with experience E."[18] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is
                        concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in
                        cognitive terms. This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper "Computing Machinery and
                        Intelligence", in which the question "Can machines think?" is replaced with the question "Can
                        machines do what we (as thinking entities) </p>
                    <p id="name">Modern-day machine learning has two objectives. One is to classify data based on models
                        which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on
                        these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of
                        moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A
                        machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential
                        predictions.[20]

                    Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transport using wheeled vehicles
                    running in tracks, which usually consist of two parallel steel rails.[1] Rail transport is one
                    of the two primary means of land transport, next to road transport. It is used for about 8% of
                    passenger and freight transport globally,[2] thanks to its energy efficiency[2] and potentially
                    high speed.</p>

                <p>Rolling stock on rails generally encounters lower frictional resistance than rubber-tyred road
                    vehicles, allowing rail cars to be coupled into longer trains. Power is usually provided by diesel
                    or electrical locomotives. While railway transport is capital-intensive and less flexible than road
                    transport, it can carry heavy loads of passengers and cargo with greater energy efficiency and
                    safety.[a]

                    Precursors of railways driven by human or animal power have existed since antiquity, but modern rail
                    transport began with the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom at the beginning of
                    the 19th century. The first passenger railway, the Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in 1825.
                    The quick spread of railways throughout Europe and North America, following the 1830 opening of the
                    first intercity connection in England, was a key component of the Industrial Revolution. The

                <h3>Wooden rails introduced</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>In 1515, Cardinal Matthäus Lang wrote a description of the Reisszug, a funicular railway at the
                    Hohensalzburg Fortress in Austria. The line originally used wooden rails and a hemp haulage rope and
                    was operated by human or animal power, through a treadwheel.[5] The line is still operational,
                    although in updated form and is possibly the oldest operational railway.[6]</p>

                <p>Wagonways (or tramways) using wooden rails, hauled by horses, started appearing in the 1550s to
                    facilitate the transport of ore tubs to and from mines and soon became popular in Europe. Such an
                    operation was illustrated in Germany in 1556 by Georgius Agricola in his work De re metallica.[7]
                    This line used "Hund" carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the
                    truck fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the
                    wagons Hunde ("dogs") from the noise they made on the tracks.[8]</p>

                <p>There are many references to their use in central Europe in the 16th century.[9] Such a transport
                    system was later used by German miners at Caldbeck, Cumbria, England, perhaps from the 1560s.[10] A
                    wagonway was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, sometime around 1600, possibly as early as 1594.
                    Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to a terminus about
                    one-half mile (800 m) away.[11] A funicular railway was also made at Broseley in Shropshire some
                    time before 1604. This carried coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the River Severn to be
                    loaded onto barges and carried to riverside towns.[12] The Wollaton Wagonway, completed in 1604 by
                    Huntingdon Beaumont, has sometimes erroneously been cited as the earliest British railway. It ran
                    from Strelley to Wollaton near Nottingham.[13]</p>

                <p> The Middleton Railway in Leeds, which was built in 1758, later became the world's oldest operational
                    railway (other than funiculars), albeit now in an upgraded form. In 1764, the first railway in the
                    Americas was built in Lewiston, New York.[14]</p>

                <p>The food industry is a complex, global network of diverse businesses that supplies most of the food
                    consumed by the world's population. The food industry today has become highly diversified, with
                    manufacturing ranging from small, traditional, family-run activities that are highly
                    labour-intensive, to large, capital-intensive and highly mechanized industrial processes. Many food
                    industries depend almost entirely on local agriculture, animal farms, produce, and/or fishing</p>

                <p>It is challenging to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale. The UK
                    Food Standards Agency describes it as "the whole food industry – from farming and food production,
                    packaging and distribution, to retail and catering".[2] The Economic Research Service of the USDA
                    uses the term food system to describe the same thing, stating: "The U.S. food</p>
                <p>system is a complex network of farmers and the industries that link to them. Those links include
                    makers of farm equipment and chemicals as well as firms that provide services to agribusinesses,
                    such as providers of transportation and financial services. The system also includes the food
                    marketing industries that link farms to consumers, and which include food and fiber processors,
                    wholesalers, retailers, and foodservice establishments."[3] The food industry includes:

                    Agriculture: raising crops, livestock, and seafood. Agricultural economics.
                    Manufacturing: agrichemicals, agricultural construction, farm machinery and supplies, seed, etc.</p>

                <p>Agricultural machinery relates to the mechanical structures and devices used in farming or other
                    agriculture. There are many types of such equipment, from hand tools and power tools to tractors and
                    the farm implements that they tow or operate. Machinery is used in both organic and nonorganic
                    farming. Especially since the advent of mechanised agriculture, agricultural machinery is an
                    indispensable part of how the world is fed</p>

                <p>Agricultural machinery can be regarded as part of wider agricultural automation technologies, which
                    includes the more advanced digital equipment and agricultural robotics.[1] While robots have the
                    potential to automate the three key steps involved in any agricultural operation (diagnosis,
                    decision-making and performing), conventional motorized machinery is used principally to automate
                    only the performing step where diagnosis and decision-making are conducted by humans based on
                    observations and experience</p>
